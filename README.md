# @streamby/core

Middleware framework for building storage-agnostic media APIs.  
Part of the [StreamBy](https://streamby.nhexa.cl) ecosystem by TerminalCore Labs.

---

## 🚀 What is it?

`@streamby/core` is a plug-and-play middleware for Express (or compatible frameworks) that enables file uploads, listings and **multi-project access** over services like:

- ✅ AWS S3
- ✅ Google Cloud Storage (soon)
- ✅ Cloudflare R2 (soon)
- ✅ Local/Personal servers (soon)

It's designed to be installed inside your existing API as a library — **no need to run a separate backend**.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @streamby/core
```

---

## 🧱 Basic usage

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { createStreamByRouter } from '@streamby/core';

const app = express();

app.use('/streamby', createStreamByRouter({
  storageProvider: {
    type: 's3',
    config: {
      bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
      region: 'your-region',
      accessKeyId: 'YOUR_AWS_KEY',
      secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET'
    }
  },
  authProvider: async (req) => {
    // extract token/cookie and validate
    return {
      userId: 'demo',
      projects: ['demo-project'],
      role: 'admin',
    };
  },
  projectProvider: async (projectId) => {
    // fetch project from your DB
    return {
      id: projectId,
      name: 'Demo Project',
      description: 'Demo for StreamBy integration',
      rootFolders: [],
      settings: { allowUpload: true }
    };
  }
}));

app.listen(3000);
```
